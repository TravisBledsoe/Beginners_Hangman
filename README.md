# Beginners_Hangman
a beginner trying to put together first simple hangman in python 3

# The user needs to be able to input letter guesses.
# A limit should also be set on how many guesses they can use.
# This means youâ€™ll need a way to grab a word to use for guessing.
#  (This can be grabbed from a pre-made list. No need to get too fancy.)
#  You will also need functions to check if the user has actually inputted
#  a single letter, to check if the inputted letter is in the hidden word
#  (and if it is, how many times it appears), to print letters, and a counter
#  variable to limit guesses.
# Concepts to keep in mind:

# Random
# Variables
# Boolean
# Input and Output
# Integer
# Char
# String
# Length
# Print
# from random import choice
